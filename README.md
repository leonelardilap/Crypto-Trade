## Market dynamics

The value of one BTC could be model as a discrete time serie $$\left \{X_t \right \}$$ of its price with respect the USDT over time. The price moves up and down fluctuating over time, these variations let us to buy BTC  are precisely what help us to maximize the amount of USDT available.
$${X}_{t_0}, {X}_{t_1}, \cdots, {X}_{t_i}, \cdots, {X}_{t_j}, \cdots ,{X}_{t_i}$$
\noindent We can take advantage of these variations to exchange (**buy**) BTC at a given price in USDT and then, after a while, exchange the BTC (**sell**) it for USDT at a much higher price to obtain a profit.
